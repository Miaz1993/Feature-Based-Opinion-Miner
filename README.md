# Opinion-miner
Design a feature-based opinion mining algorithm
from employees’ feedback to unlock the hidden insights. 
The algorithm uses natural languages techniques to extract employees’ concerns from texts,
apply sentiment analysis among these concerns and generate concern-sentiment labels accordingly.  
To output our result, we train labels with state of arts machine learning and deep learning models.
